# HTMl/CSS/JS

- Classes should be named according to their function. We are using the namespaced
style for child `<div>`s, i.e. append a `-`. e.g. Login button under 
`<div class="login">` should be called `login-button` and so forth.
- Most things that have some sort of seperate functionality should probably be
 wrapped in a `<div>` or `<span>` as appopriate.
